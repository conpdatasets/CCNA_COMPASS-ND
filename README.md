The major goals of the study are:
<ul>
<li>To learn about who is at risk of developing dementia</li>
<li>To determine how early dementia can be detected</li>
<li>To find out what tests are most effective at detecting dementia</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The COMPASS-ND Study is an observational study of people with various types of dementia or cognitive complaints. The study collects clinical, neuropsychological, and MRI imaging data as well as blood, saliva, and urine samples from participants.
